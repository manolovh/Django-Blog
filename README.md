# Basic Blog created with Python, using the Django framework.

The project is deployed on http://djangoblog-env-1.eba-uzd27en3.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/ with additional features.



This is the starting page. Here we can see some info about the author, navigation to all posts and the three latest posts in the blog.
